**Author:** Gabi Montes De Oca

**Due date:** 11 March 2016

## Description
For this homework, we completed excercises out of the book and used a turtle program to draw shapes.

## What I Learned from This
I learned what a turtle program is and I learned how to use a turtle program to "draw" images on a computer. I also learned how boolean statements work and how round off errors affect a program.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Gabi Montes De Oca
